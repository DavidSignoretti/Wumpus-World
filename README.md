# Wumpus World
SCS_3547_008 Intelligent Agents &amp; Reinforcement Learning

"Wumpus World" is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and computer science, first introduced by computer scientist Stuart Russell in his book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach." It is a simple game-like environment that consists of a grid of rooms connected by passageways.

In this world, there is a monster called the Wumpus that lives in one of the rooms. The Wumpus is deadly and can kill any agent that enters its room. There are also pits in some of the rooms, and falling into a pit will also result in the agent's death.

The goal of the game is for an agent (such as a computer program) to navigate through the world, avoiding the Wumpus and pits, and find a gold treasure that is hidden somewhere in the world. The agent can only perceive its immediate surroundings and must use its reasoning abilities to make decisions about which actions to take, such as moving to a different room or shooting an arrow to try to kill the Wumpus.

The Wumpus World is often used as a benchmark problem for testing and comparing different AI algorithms and approaches, such as search algorithms, planning algorithms, and decision-making algorithms.
